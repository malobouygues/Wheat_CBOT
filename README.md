## Calendar Spreads & Carry Seasonality

**The Question**: Is the current term structure incentivizing storage (Contango) or demanding immediate delivery (Backwardation) relative to historical harvest cycles?

**Objective**: To model the Cost of Carry on CBOT Soft Red Winter Wheat. This project filters out "Black Swan" events (War, Agflation) to isolate the standard "Cash & Carry" arbitrage window and visualize liquidity premiums during the critical July/Dec rollout.

## Fundamentals & USDA Bias

**The Question**: Is the balance sheet actually tightening, or is the market just reacting to nominal inventory noise?

**Objective**: To decode the WASDE (World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates) reports. This tool moves beyond static "Ending Stocks" to visualize dynamic Stocks-to-Use ratios, identifying real scarcity and analyzing the seasonality of USDA revision biases throughout the marketing year.
